                    <h2>Assignments</h2>
                    <p>There will be 11 programming-intensive assignments, usually given at the start of each programming workshop. In general, assignments are due one week after they are assigned. All assignments—including attachments—should be submitted via NYU Brightspace.</p>

                        <li>Log into NYU Brightspace with your NYU NetID and password.</li>

                    <h2>Policies</h2>
                    <p>Assignments that you turn in should be your own work. If you would like to work together with one other person on a homework assignment you may do so as long as you both submit the same file and you both write a comment that you worked together. For reference, here is the Computer Science Department’s <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/policy.html">statement on academic integrity</a>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Do your best to keep up with assignments. 10% will be deducted for each class day late, with a possible maximum of 30% being deducted for each assignment. Homework will not be accepted past the third class after its assigned due date without prior permission. Likewise, no assignments will be accepted after the final exam..</p>
