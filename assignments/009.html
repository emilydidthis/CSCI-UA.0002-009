<h3>Part 1</h3>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
	<p>This program relies on a series of data files. Simply right-click on the links below (control-click on a Mac) and select Save-As to save these files to your computer.  Ensure that these files are stored in a folder that contains your source code file (i.e. 'LastnameFirstname_assign9_part1.py') for this project as well.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><a href="assignment-resources/class_data.txt" target="_blank">class_data.txt</a></li>

<br>
<p>You've been hired by NYU's Computer Science department to create a tool that will allow professors to look up their course rosters online.  Currently course registration data is stored using two different text files.</p>

<h4>class_data.txt</h4>
<p>Stores the course ID and the title of each course.  There will always be one record in this file for every course that the CS department is currently offering.  Here's what this file looks like:</p>
<pre>CS0002,Introduction to Computer Programming
CS0004,Introduction to Web Design and Computer Principles
CS0060,Database Design and Implementation
CS0061,Web Development
CS0101,Introduction to Computer Science
CS0102,Data Structures
CS0201,Computer Systems Organization
CS0380,Special Topics in Computer Science</pre>

<h4>enrollment_data.txt</h4>
<p>Stores the course ID, last name and first name of each student enrolled in the course.  Note that there are multiple records per course (one per student enrolled).  For example, here's the beginning of this file showing six students enrolled in CS0002:</p>
<pre>CS0002,Hiner,Judith
CS0002,Mcmahon,Ludivina
CS0002,Trusty,Beatrice
CS0002,Brinn,Jacqulyn
CS0002,Hintzen,Floria
CS0002,Amyx,Randolph</pre>

<p>Your task is to write a program that asks the user for a course ID.  The program will then determine if the course ID is valid or not -- if it is not, the program can safely end.  If it is valid, the program should report the full title of the course, how many students are enrolled in the course and the names of each student enrolled.</p>

<p><strong>You cannot hard code your program to only work with the values contained within these files</strong>.  When we test your work we will be using completely different data files that are organized in the same way as these sample files.  Your program should work flawlessly using this new data.</p>

<p>Here are a few sample runnings of how this program should operate (user input is underlined):</p>

<pre>NYU Computer Science Registration System
Enter a course ID (i.e. CS0002, CS0004): <u>PIKACHU</u>
Cannot find this course</pre>

<pre>NYU Computer Science Registration System
Enter a course ID (i.e. CS0002, CS0004): <u>CS0002</u>
The title of this class is: Introduction to Computer Programming
The course has 6 students enrolled
* Hiner,Judith
* Mcmahon,Ludivina
* Trusty,Beatrice
* Brinn,Jacqulyn
* Hintzen,Floria
* Amyx,Randolph</pre>

<pre>NYU Computer Science Registration System
Enter a course ID (i.e. CS0002, CS0004): <u>CS0004</u>
The title of this class is: Introduction to Web Design and Computer Principles
The course has 7 students enrolled
* Woodman,Tilda
* Schneiderman,Saran
* Conn,Glayds
* Cales,Edgar
* Hiner,Judith
* Lukens,Refugio
* Alfrey,Jerrica</pre>

<pre>NYU Computer Science Registration System
Enter a course ID (i.e. CS0002, CS0004): <u>CS0201</u>
The title of this class is: Computer Systems Organization
The course has 0 students enrolled</pre>

<p>Some hints to get you started:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ensure that your source code file ('LastnameFirstname_assign9_part1.py') is saved in a folder along with the data files linked above.</li>
	<li>Begin by asking the user for a course name. You will need to consult with the 'class_data.txt' file to check to make sure the course is valid, as well as determine the title of the course. This most likely will involve reading the file and examining each line in the file to see if the name on that line matches the name the user supplied.</li>
	<li>Hint: How can you isolate each line in the file?  What separates each line?  How can you break each line apart into a list (split!)</li>
	<li>Hint: You will need a loop to examine each line once they have been isolated.  Next you will need to identify if the course name matches the user input.  What separates each value on this line?  You might need to split the line again to isolate these values.</li>
	<li>If you find a valid course you will then nee to interface with the 'enrollment_data.txt' file to find all students enrolled in this course.  The process for examining this file will be similar to the one you went through for the 'class_data.txt' file.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>This program should be named as follows: LastNameFirstName_assign9_part1.py</p>



<h3>Part 2</h3>

<p>Note that the programs you will be writing build on one another. You will want to attempt these parts in order. You can also feel free to save all of your work in one big file (call it "LastNameFirstName_assign9_part2.py")</p>

<p>You have just been hired by a tech startup that is planning on releasing a new e-mail service to its clients.  They have asked you to create a prototype of this service using your Python skills.  The final version of this prototype should do the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Allow the user to register for a new account.  When they register, they will supply a username and password, which will need to be validated.  The username will also need to be unique (i.e. only one person can have a given username). If the user registers successfully their information will need to be stored in a permeant storage mechanism (in this case, a file)</li>
	<li>The user should also be able to log into their account.  This part of the system will ask the user for a username and password and match it up against the one the company has on file for them.  Note that the company plans on having millions of clients, so this information must be cross-referenced against a file and cannot be 'hard-coded'.</li>
	<li>The user should be able to send messages to any other user on the system.  To send a message the system will ask the user for the name of a recipient and a message to send (one line of text).  If the recipient is registered the message will be delivered through a file.</li>
	<li>The user should be able to read messages that have been sent to them (and only them)</li>
	<li>The user should be able to delete all of the messages that have been sent to them (and only them)</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>In order to do this the software engineers at the company have outlined a series of functions that will need to be build to create the prototype.  Your job is to build these functions and test them as you go - don't skip ahead!  When all of the necessary functions are built you will use them to construct the prototype e-mail system</p>

<h3>Part 2a</h3>

<p>Begin by writing functions that conform to the following IPO specifications.  Tester code is listed below each function.</p>

<pre># function:   valid_username
# input:      a username (string)
# processing: determines if the username supplied is valid.  for the purpose
#             of this program a valid username is defined as follows:
#             (1) must be 5 characters or longer
#             (2) must be alphanumeric (only letters or numbers)
#             (3) the first character cannot be a number
# output:     boolean (True if valid, False if invalid)


# TESTER CODE
print( valid_username('abc123') )    # True
print( valid_username('abcde')  )    # True
print( valid_username('abc')    )    # False
print( valid_username('@#$%^')  )    # False
print( valid_username('1abcde') )    # False
print( valid_username('')       )    # False</pre>

<pre># function:   valid_password
# input:      a password (string)
# processing: determines if the password supplied is valid.  for the purpose
#             of this program a valid password is defined as follows:
#             (1) must be 5 characters or longer
#             (2) must be alphanumeric (only letters or numbers)
#             (3) must contain at least one lowercase letter
#             (4) must contain at least one uppercase letter
#             (5) must contain at least one number
# output:     boolean (True if valid, False if invalid)


# TESTER CODE
print( valid_password('Abc123')     )   # True
print( valid_password('Abc123xyz')  )   # True
print( valid_password('Ab12')       )   # False
print( valid_password('abc123')     )   # False
print( valid_password('123456')     )   # False
print( valid_password('Abc123#')    )   # False
print( valid_password('')           )   # False</pre>


<h3>Part 2b</h3>

<p>Now that you can validate usernames and passwords it's time to write some code that will register new user accounts.  In order to do this you will need to create a file that will contain the usernames and passwords for all users of the system.  This file - <a href="assignment-resources/user_info.txt">which you can download here</a> - is set up with five demo accounts and is organized as follows:</p>

<pre>pikachu,Abc123
charmander,Xyz123
squirtle,SquirtleSquad99
Pidgey2020,Pqr123
fearow,Pidgey2020</pre>

<p>Note that this file is organized as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The file is organized into multiple lines</li>
	<li>Each line represents a single user</li>
	<li>On each line there are two values, separated by commas.  The first value (before the comma) is the username and the second value (after the comma) is the password for that user.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>The first thing you will want to do is download this file and save it in the same folder as your source code file for this program.  Once this file is in place you can begin writing the following two functions:</p>

<pre># function:   username_exists
# input:      a username (string)
# processing: determines if the username exists in the file 'user_info.txt'
# output:     boolean (True if found, False if not found)


# TESTER CODE
print( username_exists('pikachu')           )   # True
print( username_exists('charmander')        )   # True
print( username_exists('squirtle')          )   # True
print( username_exists('Pidgey2020')        )   # True
print( username_exists('SquirtleSquad99')   )   # False
print( username_exists('eevee')             )   # False
print( username_exists('bobcat')            )   # False
print( username_exists('')                  )   # False</pre>

<pre># function:   check_password
# input:      a username (string) and a password (string)
# processing: determines if the username / password combination
#             supplied matches one of the user accounts represented
#             in the 'user_info.txt' file
# output:     boolean (True if valid, False if invalid)


# TESTER CODE
print( check_password('pikachu', 'Abc123')              )    # True
print( check_password('squirtle', 'SquirtleSquad99')    )    # True
print( check_password('fearow', 'Pqr123')               )    # False
print( check_password('foobar', 'Hello123')             )    # False
print( check_password('', '')                           )    # False</pre>


<h3>Part 2c</h3>

<p>For this part you will be writing a function that will create new users for the system.  This function should be designed as follows:</p>

<pre># function:   add_user
# input:      a username (string) and a password (string)
# processing: if the user being supplied is not already in the
#             'user_info.txt' file they should be added, along with
#             their password.
# output:     boolean (True if added successfully, False if not)


# TESTER CODE
add_user('foobar', 'abcABC123')
add_user('barfoo', 'xyz123ABC')
add_user('foobar', 'aTest123') # this should fail

# OUTPUT - check 'user_info.txt' to ensure that that two new accounts have been created</pre>


<h3>Part 2d</h3>

<p>Next you will need to write a function to allow users to send messages to one another.  Messages will be stored in a folder named 'messages' which you will need to create.  Your file structure should look as follows:</p>

<pre>assignment09/                                          (folder)
                  LastNameFirstName_assign9_part2.py   (main program)
                  user_info.txt                        (user database)
                  messages/                            (folder)</pre>

<p>After you have manually created this 'messages' folder you be able to start sending messages from one user to another.  When a user is registered with the system we will create a new file in this 'messages' folder for that user - the name of this file will be their username with the file extension '.txt' - for example, if I register an account called 'snorlax' a file called 'snorlax.txt' should be created inside of the 'messages' folder for this user.  All messages that will be sent to this user will be stored in this file.</p>

<p>Note that you can easily create, edit and read files in sub-folders by using this syntax:</p>

<pre>file = open('messages/somefile.txt', 'w') 	
# opens a new file named 'somefile.txt' for writing inside of the 'messages' folder</pre>

<p>Here's the function IPO for the new function that can be used to send messages:</p>

<pre># function:   send_message
# input:      a sender (string), a recipient (string) and a message (string)
# processing: writes a new line into the specific messages file for the given users
#             with the following information:
#
#             sender|date_and_time|message\n
#
#             for example, if you call this function using the following arguments:
#
#             send_message('craig', 'pikachu', 'Hello there! nice to see you!')
#
#             the file 'messages/pikachu.txt' should gain an additional line data
#             that looks like the following:
#
#             craig|11/14/2020 12:30:05|Hello there! nice to see you!\n
#
#             note that you can generate the current time by doing the following:
#
#             import datetime
#             d = datetime.datetime.now()
#             month = d.month
#             day = d.day
#             year = d.year
#             ... etc. for hour, minute and second
#
#             keep in mind that you may need to 'append' to the correct messages file
#             since a user can receive an unlimited number of messages.  you may also
#             need to create a new message file if one does not exist for a user.
# output:     nothing


# TESTER CODE
send_message('pikachu', 'charmander', 'Hey there!')
send_message('charmander', 'pikachu', 'Good to see you!')
send_message('pikachu', 'charmander', 'You too, ttyl')

# OUTPUT - two new messages files should be created - 'pikachu.txt' and 'charmander.txt'
# each should have the following content (dates will be different, though)
#
# pikachu.txt
# charmander|11/14/2020 13:37:15|Good to see you!
#
# charmander.txt
# pikachu|11/14/2020 13:37:15|Hey there!
# pikachu|11/14/2020 13:37:15|You too, ttyl</pre>

<p>Once this is working as expected you should update your 'add_user' function so that every time a new user is added a default message is sent to that user welcoming them to the system.  This message should be sent from the user account 'admin' and should contain the text 'Welcome to your account!'</p>

<h3>Part 2e</h3>

<p>Finally you will be writing two additional functions to complete the tools needed to write this program.  The first function you will be writing will print out all messages for a specific user.  Here's the IPO for this function:</p>

<pre># function:   print_messages
# input:      a username (string)
# processing: prints all messages sent to the username in question.  assume you have this file named 'pikachu.txt':
#
#             charmander|11/14/2020 13:37:15|Hey there!
#             charmander|11/14/2020 13:37:15|You too, ttyl
#
#             this function should generate the following output:
#
#             Message #1 received from charmander
#             Time: 11/14/2020 13:37:15
#             Hey there!
#
#             Message #2 received from charmander
#             Time: 11/14/2020 13:37:15
#             You too, ttyl
# output:     no return value (simply prints the messages)</pre>

<p>Once you can print messages successfully the last function you will need to write will be a function to delete all messages for a given user.  The IPO for this function is as follows:</pre>

<pre># function:   delete_messages
# input:      a username (string)
# processing: erases all data in the messages file for this user
# output:     no return value</pre>

<h3>Part 2f</h3>

<p>Now you are ready to write the main program for this project!  Here's what your program should do:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Present the user with a menu of choices - login, register or quit</li>
	<li>If they choose to quit you should immeidately end the program.</li>
	<li>If they choose to register you should prompt them for a username and a password. Ensure that the username and password are valid using your functions.  Then ensure that the username has not already been taken.  If all of these items are OK you can go ahead and register the user for an account and return them back to the main menu.</li>
	<li>If they choose to login you should prompt them for a username and a password.  If the username and password is correct they should be logged in.  They then should receive a new menu of options (hint - user a nested 'while' loop for this):
		<ul>
			<li>Present the user with the options to read messages, send messages, delete messages or logout</li>
			<li>If they choose to logout they should return to the main menu</li>
			<li>If they choose to read messages you should display their messages</li>
			<li>If they choose to delete messages you should delete all their messages</li>
			<li>If they choose to send a message you should prompt them for a recipient username and a message.  If the recipient is unknown you should reject the message.  If they are known, you should send a message to that user using your function.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>Here's a sample running of the program.  This program assumes that you have an empty "user_info.txt" file (no users registered) and an empty 'messages' folder (folder exists, but no files are stored inside of it).  User input is underlined:</p>

<p>Important note: your program should be able to be "re-run" after the sample code above and pick up where it left off due to the fact that relevant data is being stored in a series of permanent files on your computer.  For example, the following code was run days after the original output above - note how the system is able to "pick up" where it left off after the first run.</p>

<h3>Part 3</h3>

<p class="alert alert-warning">Note on opening web-based files:  the program below assumes that your computer can access files using the "urllib" module.  If this module does not work for you then you may have to install an additional module that will allow Python to communicate with the web.  On a Mac you can simply visit your 'Applications' folder and find the 'Python 3' folder.  Inside of this folder should be a program labeled 'install certificate command' -- double click on this to install this program to your computer.  On a PC you shouldn't need to do anything.  If for some reason this does not work <a href="assignment-resources/assignment9_image_data_files.zip" target="_blank">you can download all of the files that are needed for this project here</a>.  Note that you should ZIP up your entire folder (including these files) when submitting your homework to NYU Classes.</p>

<p>For this assignment you will be writing an image parser which will act as a "translator" to convert a series of data files into pictures.  This process is not unlike how Photoshop and other graphic design programs process digital image information.</p>

<p>Note that the programs you will be writing build on one another. You will want to attempt these parts in order. You can also feel free to save all of your work in one big file (call it "LastNameFirstName_assign9_part3.py")</p>

<h3>Part 3a</h3>

<p>Write a program that prompts the user for the name of an image file (i.e. "image1", "image2", etc).  Then attempt to download the data associated with the specified image from the following location:</p>

<pre>https://cs.nyu.edu/~kapp/python/</pre>

<p>For example, if the user types in the name "image1" you should attempt to download data from this location.  Note that you will need to add the ".txt" file extension to the string that the user enters.</p>

<pre>https://cs.nyu.edu/~kapp/python/image1.txt</pre>

<p>The user may enter an image file that does not exist on the server (i.e. the image file "image0.txt" is not a filename that we will be using).  If you cannot download for any reason you should display an "image not found" error  message and end the program.  Your program should not crash.</p>

<p>As a review, here is the syntax for downloading a file using the urllib module in Python:</p>

<pre>import urllib.request

# define a location for our file
url = "https://cs.nyu.edu/~kapp/python/image1.txt"

# open a connection to the URL
response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)

# read data from URL as a string
data = response.read().decode('utf-8');</pre>

<p>And here are two sample runnings of this part of your program:</p>

<pre>Enter an image filename:  image0
Sorry, 'image0.txt' doesn't exist.
Enter an image filename:  image1
Success!  I was able to find 'image1.txt'</pre>

<h3>Part 3b</h3>

<p>Extend your program and write in an image "parser" that will translate data stored in an image file on the web into a picture on the user's screen.</p>

<p>Begin by testing your program using the following image file (the user should just be able to type in "image1" to run this part of your program):</p>

<pre>https://cs.nyu.edu/~kapp/python/image1.txt</pre>

<p>Once you obtain data from this file you should print it out - you will see that it contains the following information:</p>

<pre>500,500,0.5</pre>

<p>This information represents the width, height and background color (in greyscale) of the desired image separated by commas.  Your program should obtain this information, decode and unpack it from its string and use Turtle graphics to generate the desired image.  Hint:  use the string "split" method and a list!</p>

<p>The image that you should generate based on the data stored in the "image1.txt" data file should appear as follows (500 x 500 image filled with a 50% grey background)</p>

<img src="assignment-resources/image1.png" width="300" height="313" alt=""/>

<p>Note that greyscale color can be generated by using the same floating point number for the red, green and blue channels.  So to fill a shape with a greyscale color you can do the following:</p>
  
<pre>greyscale = 0.25
turtle.fillcolor(greyscale, greyscale, greyscale)</pre>

<p>Also make use of lots of "print" statements as you go.  There are a lot of "moving parts" that need to be written for this portion of the project, so it can be helpful to make sure you know what kind of data you are working with if you start to get lost or confused.  Don't attempt to do too much at once â€“ try and break down the problem into manageable steps.  Also, feel free to use any of your previously written functions if you'd like (i.e. the polygon function from the turtle graphics lecture)</p>
  
<p>Your parser should also work with the following data files as well:</p>
  
<pre>https://cs.nyu.edu/~kapp/python/image1a.txt
https://cs.nyu.edu/~kapp/python/image1b.txt</pre>
  
<h3>Part 3c</h3>
  
<p>Extend your program so that it can also parse the image file that exists at the following location:</p>
  
<pre>https://cs.nyu.edu/~kapp/python/image2.txt</pre>

<p>This image file contains the following data:</p>
  
<pre>500,500,0.5,50,1.0,0.75,0.50,0.25,0.00</pre>

<p>Which represents the following:</p>
  
<pre>image width, image height, background color, pixel size, pixel 1 color, pixel 2 color, 
pixel 3 color, pixel 4 color</pre>
  
<p>You should start drawing pixels (i.e. squares of color) from the top left side of the image (in this case -250, 250) â€“ be sure to use the image size when calculating where to start drawing your pixels!  Once you draw a pixel you should move over to the right by the specifed amount so that pixels do not overlap one another.  This data file should generate the following image:</p>
  
<img src="assignment-resources/image2.png" width="300" height="311" alt=""/> 
  
  <p>Note that an image file can contain a varying number of pixels.  One image file may render 5 pixels like the above image, and another may render only 3.  You should use the size of your list to determine how many pixels need to be generated.  Note:  it would be very helpful at this point to write in a "draw_box" function to draw your pixels to the screen!</p>
  
<p>Your parser should also work with the following data files as well:</p>
  
<pre>https://cs.nyu.edu/~kapp/python/image2a.txt
https://cs.nyu.edu/~kapp/python/image2b.txt
https://cs.nyu.edu/~kapp/python/image2c.txt</pre>

<div class="alert alert-danger"><strong>Important Note on Speed:</strong> By default, the turtle graphics library will draw your image very slowly.  You can speed this up by using   the following technique:

<pre># at the beginning of your program, right after you create your graphics window

# tell the program to not draw any graphics to the screen - your picture will exist
# in your computer's memory but will not be painted to the screen
turtle.tracer(0)


# now do all of your graphics work



# at the very end of your program

# tell the program to draw everything in memory onto the screen all at once
turtle.update()</pre></div>

<h3>Part 3d</h3>
  
<p>Extend your program so that it can also parse the image file that exists at the following location:</p>
  
<pre>https://cs.nyu.edu/~kapp/python/image3.txt</pre>

<p>This image file contains the following data:</p>
  
<pre>500,500,0.5,50,1.0,0.90,0.80,0.70,0.60,0.50,0.40,0.30,0.20,0.10,0.00,b,0.00,0.05,0.10,
0.15,0.20,0.25,0.30,0.35,0.40,0.45,0.50</pre>

<p>Which represents the following:</p>
  
<pre>image width, image height, background color, pixel size, pixel 1 color, pixel 2 color, 
pixel 3 color, pixel 4 color, ... , line break character ("b"), pixel color, pixel color, 
pixel color, ...</pre>
  
<p>When you encounter a line break character in your file (the string "b") you should skip down to the next line of your image and continue drawing pixels from the left side of the screen.  This is just like "word wrap" in Microsoft Word, but for pixels.   The image stored in "image3.txt" should look as follows:</p>
 
<img src="assignment-resources/image3.png" width="300" height="311" alt=""/> 

<p>Your parser should also work with the following data files as well:</p>
  
<pre>https://cs.nyu.edu/~kapp/python/image3a.txt
https://cs.nyu.edu/~kapp/python/image3b.txt
https://cs.nyu.edu/~kapp/python/image3c.txt</pre>
  
<p>Next, extend your program so that it can also handle images that contain color (Red, Green and Blue) images in addition to greyscale images.  Image files that contain RBG color values have a special "color mode" flag at position 4  (see below). They also contain 3 color values per pixel â€“ the first one maps to the redness of the pixel, the second one maps to the greenness and the third maps to the blueness.</p>
  
<p>Here's a sample file that contains color values:
  
<pre>640,480,0.5,10,true,0.11,0.20,0.30,0.10,0.20,0.10,0.50,0.60,0.90,b</pre>

<p>And here are a few sample images along with their solutions. Note that to get full credit for the extra credit your program must handle BOTH black and white and RGB color images (i.e. I should be able to ask your program to display image3.txt as well as image4.txt and both should render correctly)</p>
  
  
  <img src="assignment-resources/image4.png" width="300" height="312" alt=""/> <br>
  <pre>https://cs.nyu.edu/~kapp/python/image4.txt</pre> 
  
  <img src="assignment-resources/image4a.png" width="300" height="438" alt=""/> <br><pre>https://cs.nyu.edu/~kapp/python/image4a.txt
</pre>  
  
  <img src="assignment-resources/image4b.png" width="300" height="310" alt=""/> <br><pre>https://cs.nyu.edu/~kapp/python/image4b.txt</pre>
