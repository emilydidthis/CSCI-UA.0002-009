                    <p>Three years of high school mathematics or equivalent. No prior computer experience assumed. Students with any programming experience should consult with the computer science department before registering. Students who have taken or are taking CSCI-UA 101 will not receive credit for this course. Note: This course is not intended for computer science majors, although it is a prerequisite for students with no previous programming experience who want to continue in CSCI-UA 101. Offered every semester. 4 points.</p>

                        <p>The main software package that we will be working with this semester is the Python programming language. Python is an open-source project, and anyone can get their own copy free of charge at <a href="http://www.python.org/download">http://www.python.org/download</a>. We will be using Python 3.x this semester. Installation instructions are posted to the Common Syllabus.</p>

                    <h2>Class Format</h2>
                    <p>This course incorporates a “blended learning” format. In our case, this means that a portion of the lecture and reading material is presented in interactive, online modules and more time is spent programming together in class. Essentially, the course consists of three primary components:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <h3>Online Learning Modules</h3>
                        <p>Before new topics are discussed in class, you will be expected to complete a corresponding <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/elearning/CSCI_UA_0002/module01.php">online learning module</a>. These modules contain video, text, and interactive programming exercises. When you are finished with a module you will be asked to take a short online quiz via <a href="brightspace.nyu.edu">NYU Brightspace</a> to test your understanding of the concepts presented in the module.
                        </p>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h3>In-class discussion and application of principles</h3>
                        <p>One class period per week will focus on the design concepts and application of the principles taught in the online learning module.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h3>In-class workshops</h3>
                        <p>A weekly assignment will be presented in the other class period. The professor and one or more tutors will be available in class to provide support and guidance.</p>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Quizzes</h2>
                    <p>There will be eleven quizzes that go along with each online learning module. These quizzes, which contain a series of multiple-choice questions, are worth a small portion of your final grade. Quizzes are delivered via <a href="brightspace.nyu.edu">NYU Brightspace</a> and can be attempted up to three times—your highest score will be the one recorded. Quizzes must be completed before class on the day in which they are due. Unlike assignments, no late submissions will be accepted for missed quizzes.</p>
